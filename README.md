Blackjack (LogicSphere Studio)

Why did I make it?

This is a Hangman game with UI I've made in Python using 'tkinter' library. I've created this for a project in college where we were a team and had to create a website for a fictional company and attach some "personal projects" that the company would have. The team was structured in 4 people where 2 were doing the website (in WordPress), 1 was managing social media and me who had to do the projects I was talking about.

What have you learned?

I have learned how to separate my code better through functions.
I have learned to get out of my comfort zone and try something new.
Of course, I have learned a lot of things in Python basics and how to manipulate OpenAI to get the answers I need (because it's not really that smart in certain things).

What tech did you use?

I've used just Visual Studio Code to code the entire app in Python, with 'tkinter' library.

What went well?

Certainly the ambition. I don't know a lot of things in Python, yet I managed to get the things done. Slow but steady.
Also, I was not afraid to request help and admit my failures. This happens.

What went poorly?

Time management. The project took me quite a while due to trying to learn new things, failing a lot, and at some point I was coding without thinking. I have to work on that.
Grid system. I still struggle on how to use it - this part was made with the help of my friend who has knowledge in front-end (since this system is used there)
